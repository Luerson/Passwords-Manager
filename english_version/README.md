This is my free Harvard CS50 intro to programming course completion project.

The purpose of the program is to store several passwords in a safe way that can be recovered by the user whenever he wants. All
passwords are encrypted before being saved in the database (sqlite3), to give more security to the operation.

- The 'download_executable' file will be used to download the application and all the files necessary for the proper functioning
  of the program, including the icon file and the database used. Once the installation is complete, the executable program will
  be inside the downloaded folder, named 'HIDDEN' and with a lock icon.

- The files 'HIDDEN.py', 'create_db.py' and 'drop_db.py' are the Python codes used to create the application. The first is the
  code that contains the algorithm of the application itself, while the other two serve as support so that the programmer can
  more easily manipulate the database while changing the program, without applicability to the user.

- The files 'padlock.ico' and 'users.db' are necessary for the correct functioning of the program.
